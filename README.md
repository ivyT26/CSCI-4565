Contains projects from Intro to Computer Graphics course.  
Course taken at the University of Colorado Denver, Spring 2021. Professor: Min Choi.  
Coding in Visual Studio using C++, OpenGL and QT.

HW1: The program will take a mouse input from the user to display a polygon given the points the user has clicked on the window. The user holds the left click to move the point and line that conects to the previous point until they let go to permanently create the point on the screen. Right clicking on the screen will create a filled polygon and left clicking again resets the screen.  

HW2: The program draws a robot arm with an upper arm, forearm, hand, and fingers. The user can use keyboard inputs to move the joints on the arm.  

HW3: The program draws in a teapot and simulates moving a camera around an object. The program simulates the camera moving in an orbit around the object in up and down motion and moving in orbit around the object in a left and right circular motion.  

HW4: The program will implement a simple UI interface using QT to control the lighting, shading type, texture type, mesh type, environment, and rotation transformations of the object on screen.  

Final: The program will implement various UI inputs and a viewport that allows the user to control the model/object type, camera properties (eye position, look at position, and rotation), material properties (ambient, diffuse, specular, shininess), light properties for 3 light sources (position, direction vector, rotation angle, ambient, diffuse, specular, toggle lights, attenutation, point/directional light, spotlight cutoff, spotlight exponent), and toggle textures.
